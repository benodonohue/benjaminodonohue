      | As mentioned on the *about* page, coding is not my speciality. I discovered an interest for it as a bit of an experiment really. It is now something I put time into when Im not attending my regular day to day place of employment. So what is regular work for me? Well, I actually work in a factory producing potato products, thats right.. Spuds, as we call them in australia, the humble potato.. As of 2017 I have been with my employer for 12 years and really enjoy what I do.
      | Outside of work hours I have many interests other that coding and web development of course. I am a Father to two daughters and Im also married, so home life can get quite busy at times.
