    h4 About
    p So I started this site as a bit of an experiment initially. I am new to coding and never intended that the slight interest I had would evolve so much in such a short time.
    p I wanted to build <strong>a website</strong> not just place items in prepared sections and change a few colors here and there. My interest drove me deeper into static sites and what they were. A brief period into my discovery I stumbled across a static site compiler called <a href='https://github.com/jescalan/roots'>roots</a> that was developed by <a href='https://github.com/jescalan'>Jeff Escalante</a>. I tinkered with roots for a while and was amazed by it. I was fortunate to be using roots at the time <a href='https://github.com/static-dev/spike'>spike</a> was released, the successor to roots, another project by Jeff Escalante, and this is when my interest grew even further into the world of web development.
