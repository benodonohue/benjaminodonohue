      | To kick things off i will go ahead and introduce some of the components i have used to construct this site.
      | *Spike -* is a next-generation static site generator. It is built on top of webpack, and a foundation of html, css, and js parsers that accept plugins to transform the output. Itâ€™s fast, actively developed, and very data-friendly. You will need to install spike via the terminal. You can install spike by firing up terminal and running the following command:
      | `$ npm install spike -g`
      | Checkout the spike GitHub repository for more info [here](https://github.com/static-dev/spike).
      | It should be noted that Spike requires node v 6 or above. To check your node version, run:
      | `$ node -v`
      | If you need to upgrade, you can download a universal binary node installer from their website [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
      | *Netlify -* is a unified platform that automates your code to create high-performant, easily maintainable sites and web apps. Simply push your code and let them take care of the rest.
      | *This site is hosted with Netlify* &#128077;
